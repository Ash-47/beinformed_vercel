- There are extensive search options so that the news can be fine-tuned to geopgraphies and categories of interest.
- Users can register and create account after which they can follow specifiic categories and get a personalised feed based on their interests
- Almost all of the endpoints of the API are in action to serve the lastest and the greatest breaking news.
